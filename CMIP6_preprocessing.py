# This file unzips climate tifs downloaded from Worldclim.org, and 
# the expanded files are saved to a HardDrive folder "output_dir".
# Manually unzipping eight tif files for a single ssp scenario
# took 3 minutes and 24 seconds, in part due to an extensive opening
# of subfolders. In contrast, this code runs in approximately 31
# seconds, speeding processing by over 600%. Overall, we saved over
# 30 minutes when we downloaded CMIP6 data for 12 scenarios. 

# see https://www.worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6_clim2.5m.html


# It is important the files match the eight CMIP6 models in 
# model_names, and that the data are 2.5m resolution.
