## Ensemble Climate Projections 

---

All code and data required to reproduce analyses presented at the [SICB 2021 conference]() and [Supporting Information]().


## Workflow

---

The programming outputs are available in the `Xant_notebook.ipynb` Jupyter file, where each python script is ran in a easy to follow order based on the workflow of our study. 

* How can models of climate change effects on geographic distributions incorporate symbiotic species relationships? 
* What is the best quantification of uncertainty for climate forecasts in Southwest deserts?
