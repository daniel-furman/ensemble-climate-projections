## Assessing Climate Change Impacts on a Pair of Symbiotic Species with Ensemble Species Distribution Models


*How can models of climate change effects on geographic distributions incorporate symbiotic species relationships? What underlying uncertainties are contained in geospatial climate change forecasts?*

See the online notebook first: [`Comparing_MLs.ipynb`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/daniel-furman/ensemble-climate-projections/blob/main/Comparing_MLs.ipynb). All code and data required to reproduce research presented at the SICB 2021 and [SCCUR 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/114wmqQgjkc5DHLQmVI19AvlTw4K_daYQ/view?usp=sharing) conferences. Spatial classification was powered by the PyImpute library, see my open-source [contributions](https://github.com/perrygeo/pyimpute/pull/21) therein.

### Data

---
The input data is located in the `data/` subfolder. Climate information from 19 bioclimatic features (2.5 arc-minute resolution; baseline 1970-2000; with an extent from 109.3°W to 122.8°W and 31.9°N to 38.2°N) was downloaded from the publicly available [WorldClim database](https://www.worldclim.org) (v. 2.1, Fick & Hijmans, 2017). Presence data were downloaded from the publicly available Global Biodiversity Information Facility database ([GBIF](https://www.gbif.org), downloaded November 1, 2020) and Leavitt et al., 2007. In addition, the most recently updated climate forecasts were obtained from [CMIP6](https://www.worldclim.org/data/cmip6/cmip6_clim2.5m.html).

### Workflow

---

The `ML_sdms_.py` either train or validate classifiers, leaning on the PyCaret and scikit learn libraries. The `recursive-ranker.py` function recursively selected features for the modeling, below a Spearman's metric threshold. We used the rank of feature importance scores to decide which variables to drop at each recursive call. These outputs are available in `Comparing_MLs.ipynb`, along with the geospatial predictions for the baseline and future climates. Lastly, `pca_benchmark.R` calculates the similarity between the model interpolation and extrapolation data using a Jacard similarity metric among principal components.
